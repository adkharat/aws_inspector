AWS S3 bucket
In our approach, we are integrating S3 as a source for the necessary files or packages during the image build process. This can be particularly useful for fetching custom scripts, configuration files, or software packages that are stored in S3 for inclusion in your custom Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
Upload the below package like falcon-sensor, rapid7, agent_installer.sh, amazon-cloudwatch-agent.deb etc. to S3: Upload the package (e.g., software, script, or configuration files) to an S3 bucket:

falcon-sensor
rapid7
agent_installer.sh
Amazon-cloudwatch-agent

AWS VPC Gateway Endpoint
A VPC Gateway Endpoint for Amazon S3 is needed when you want to securely access Amazon S3 from within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) without exposing your traffic to the public internet. It enables direct, private connectivity between your VPC and S3, ensuring that traffic stays within the AWS network, providing enhanced security, performance, and cost savings.
Private VPCs: If your VPC is entirely private, with no internet connectivity, using a VPC Gateway Endpoint ensures you can access S3 without requiring public IP addresses or NAT.
